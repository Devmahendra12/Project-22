"# Project-Title : Energy-efficient coverage optimization in WSN"

Deployment of sensor nodes is one of the crucial factors in mobile wireless sensor networks for improving the performance of the network.

The networkâ€™s lifetime primarily depends on the consumed energy and area coverage by the sensor nodes.

The efficiency of mobile wireless sensor networks increases by the efficient deployment of the sensors.

Coverage and energy consumption mainly depends on the effective deployment schemes of sensors.

This article presents an energy-efficient coverage optimization technique with the help of the Voronoi-Glowworm Swarm Optimization-K-means algorithm.

In this approach, Glowworm Swarm Optimization, K-means algorithm, and Voronoi cell structure enhance the coverage area with a minimum number of active nodes.

This approach considers optimum sensing radius calculation for efficient sensor deployment.

Furthermore, the proposed method improves the lifetime of the deployed network by decreasing the consumed energy by the deployed sensor nodes using multi-hop transmission and the sleep-wake mechanism.

The simulation result shows that area coverage is achieved by the proposed method up to 99.

99% with the optimum number of active sensor nodes.
